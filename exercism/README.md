## two_fer.py

Two-fer or 2-fer is short for two for one. One for you and one for me.

"One for X, one for me."
When X is a name or "you".

If the given name is "Alice", the result should be "One for Alice, one for me." If no name is given, the result should be "One for you, one for me."


## pangram.py

Determine if a sentence is a pangram. A pangram (Greek: παν γράμμα, pan gramma, "every letter") is a sentence using every letter of the alphabet at least once. The best known English pangram is:

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

The alphabet used consists of ASCII letters a to z, inclusive, and is case insensitive. Input will not contain non-ASCII symbols.


## high_score.py

Manage a game player's High Score list.

Your task is to build a high-score component of the classic Frogger game, one of the highest selling and addictive games of all time, and a classic of the arcade era. Your task is to write methods that return the highest score from the list, the last added score and the three highest scores.

In this exercise, you're going to use and manipulate lists. Python lists are very versatile, and you'll find yourself using them again and again in problems both simple and complex.


## armstrong.py

An Armstrong number is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

For example:

9 is an Armstrong number, because 9 = 9^1 = 9
10 is not an Armstrong number, because 10 != 1^2 + 0^2 = 1
153 is an Armstrong number, because: 153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153
154 is not an Armstrong number, because: 154 != 1^3 + 5^3 + 4^3 = 1 + 125 + 64 = 190
Write some code to determine whether a number is an Armstrong number.

## series.py

Given a string of digits, output all the contiguous substrings of length n in that string in the order that they appear.

For example, the string "49142" has the following 3-digit series:

"491"
"914"
"142"

And the following 4-digit series:

"4914"
"9142"

And if you ask for a 6-digit series from a 5-digit string, you deserve whatever you get.

Note that these series are only required to occupy adjacent positions in the input; the digits need not be numerically consecutive.

## Protein translation (protein.py)

Translate RNA sequences into proteins.

RNA can be broken into three nucleotide sequences called codons, and then translated to a polypeptide like so:

RNA: "AUGUUUUCU" => translates to

Codons: "AUG", "UUU", "UCU" => which become a polypeptide with the following sequence =>

Protein: "Methionine", "Phenylalanine", "Serine"

There are 64 codons which in turn correspond to 20 amino acids; however, all of the codon sequences and resulting amino acids are not important in this exercise. If it works for one codon, the program should work for all of them. However, feel free to expand the list in the test suite to include them all.

There are also three terminating codons (also known as 'STOP' codons); if any of these codons are encountered (by the ribosome), all translation ends and the protein is terminated.

All subsequent codons after are ignored, like this:

RNA: "AUGUUUUCUUAAAUG" =>

Codons: "AUG", "UUU", "UCU", "UAA", "AUG" =>

Protein: "Methionine", "Phenylalanine", "Serine"

Note the stop codon "UAA" terminates the translation and the final methionine is not translated into the protein sequence.

Below are the codons and resulting Amino Acids needed for the exercise.

Codon	Protein
AUG	Methionine
UUU, UUC	Phenylalanine
UUA, UUG	Leucine
UCU, UCC, UCA, UCG	Serine
UAU, UAC	Tyrosine
UGU, UGC	Cysteine
UGG	Tryptophan
UAA, UAG, UGA	STOP
